• Understanding Development Models:
GitHub operates as a platform that hosts and supports various development models. It primarily facilitates collaborative open-source development through features like code repositories, issue tracking, and pull requests. Developers worldwide can contribute to projects, making it a hub for open-source communities. Additionally, GitHub offers private repositories for closed-source or proprietary development.

• Licensing:
GitHub itself is not a software product but a web-based platform for hosting code repositories. The licensing of the projects hosted on GitHub varies widely. Most open-source projects on GitHub use licenses like MIT, Apache, or GPL to define how others can use, modify, and distribute their code. Users can specify the license for their projects, promoting transparency and legal clarity.

• Mode of Funding:
GitHub generates revenue through various channels, including paid plans for individuals and organizations, which offer additional features and support. Additionally, GitHub offers GitHub Sponsors, a funding platform that allows users to financially support open-source developers and projects directly. Microsoft, which acquired GitHub in 2018, provides financial backing and resources, ensuring the platform's stability and growth.

• Commercial/Non-Commercial Aspects:
GitHub primarily functions as a commercial platform, offering subscription plans and services for businesses and developers. However, it also plays a crucial role in supporting non-commercial, open-source development. GitHub hosts numerous public repositories and provides tools and resources for free to open-source projects. This dual approach enables GitHub to balance its commercial interests with its commitment to open-source communities.
